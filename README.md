# bPanel Footer
Simple footer widgets for displaying useful information about your node
Includes:
- connected node agent w/ version number
- sync progress
- chain height

Note that percentage is calculated/estimated by time so a fully synced node
may sometimes show slightly less than 100%, especially when running on regtest.
